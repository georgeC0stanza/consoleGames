messing around with the console in c#

my attempt at learning c# form scratch


displays a text graphic in a 3x3 grid to the console with colors and the ability to move it around using the arrow keys.

there is a weird display bug. that the grid doesn't show up properly, some of the characters get skipt 
and when moving the grid around some "cells" get drawn out of their proper place.. 

************************************************************************
the new drawing application allows the user to draw to the screen. the user can choose a character and both a foreground and background color for the character. the controls are as follows: 'arrow keys'/'wasd' to navigate; 'spacebar' to select a character and color, or to select the placement of that character to the screen; and 'f' to return to the color picker screen to choose a new character/set of colors. 


Dependencies: Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json

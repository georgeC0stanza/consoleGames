messing around with the console in c#


displays a text graphic in a 3x3 grid to the console with colors and the ability to move it around using the arrow keys.

there is a weird display bug. that the grid doesn't show up properly, some of the characters get skipt 
and when moving the grid around some "cells" get drawn out of their proper place..

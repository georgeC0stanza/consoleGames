messing around with the console in c#

my attempt at learning c# form scratch
still in progress. i need to continue seperating it out.


displays a text graphic in a 3x3 grid to the console with colors and the ability to move it around using the arrow keys.


************************************************************************
the new drawing application allows the user to draw to the screen. the user can choose a character and both a foreground and background color for the character. the controls are as follows: 'arrow keys'/'wasd' to navigate; 'spacebar' to select a character and color, or to select the placement of that character to the screen; and 'f' to return to the color picker screen to choose a new character/set of colors. 


Dependencies: Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
